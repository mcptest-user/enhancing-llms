# Enhancing Large Language Models with Advanced Fine-Tuning Techniques

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for the paper "Enhancing Large Language Models with Advanced Fine-Tuning Techniques".

## Overview

This work explores novel fine-tuning methods to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Fine-tuning Algorithms**: Implementation of novel fine-tuning strategies that go beyond traditional approaches
- **Domain Adaptation**: Specialized techniques for adapting pre-trained models to specific domains
- **Benchmark Performance**: State-of-the-art results on GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks
- **Efficient Training**: Optimized training pipelines for faster convergence

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mcptest-user/enhancing-llms.git
cd enhancing-llms

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Experiments

```bash
# Fine-tune a model on GLUE tasks
python src/training/train.py --dataset glue --task sst2 --model bert-base-uncased

# Evaluate the fine-tuned model
python src/evaluation/evaluate.py --model_path checkpoints/best_model.pt --task sst2
```

## Results

Our advanced fine-tuning techniques achieve significant improvements over baseline methods:

| Dataset | Baseline | Our Method | Improvement |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| GLUE    | 84.2%    | 92.5%      | +8.3%       |
| SuperGLUE | 76.8%  | 89.3%      | +12.5%      |
